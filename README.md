# 💪 Calorie Calculator App

## 🔍 Project Context

The Calorie Calculator App demonstrates how data science can be used to solve real-world fitness and nutrition problems.  
It integrates data analysis, machine learning, and visualization within an interactive web interface.

### Core Objectives:
- Build a personalized calorie estimation system.
- Enable quick search and comparison of food nutritional values.
- Predict total calories based on macronutrient composition using regression modeling.
- Present data insights visually for better interpretation.

### Educational Outcome:
This project showcases the practical implementation of:
- **Pandas** for data preprocessing  
- **Scikit-learn** for linear regression modeling  
- **Matplotlib** for visualization  
- **Streamlit** for web app deployment

It reflects an end-to-end data science workflow — from **data cleaning and modeling** to **interactive app development**.

## How to Use

1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
2. Enter your personal details (age, weight, height, gender, and activity level).
3. Click “Calculate Calories” to see your BMR and TDEE.
4. Use the food search bar to find nutrition info from the dataset.
5. Use the ML prediction tool by entering protein, carbs, and fat values to estimate calories.
6. See the pie chart that shows the macro breakdown of calories.

🧮 Dataset

The app uses a custom dataset (food_data.csv) that includes:

food, calories, protein, carbs, fat
Egg, 155, 13, 1.1, 11
Rice, 130, 2.7, 28, 0.3
Chicken Breast, 165, 31, 0, 3.6
Paneer, 265, 18, 6, 20
Apple, 52, 0.3, 14, 0.2


You can modify or expand this dataset with more food items.
