# ðŸ’ª Calorie Calculator App

## Overview
The **Calorie Calculator App** is an interactive web application built using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It helps users calculate their **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**, **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**, search food nutrition details, and even **predict calories** from macronutrients using a **Machine Learning model (Linear Regression)**.

This project was created by **Usman Khan** as part of the **ISA (Internal Skill Assessment)** for the **Data Science** program.
